my Learn about open, write file
# Code Explanation
The code uses the open() function to open the file with different modes. The modes are:

1. r: Read mode
2. w: Write mode
3. a: Append mode
4. rb: Read binary mode
5. wb: Write binary mode
6. ab: Append binary mode
The with statement is used to manage file usage. The with statement ensures that the file is closed after use, which frees up system resources and prevents data corruption.

Inside the with block, we use the read() method to read the file content, and the write() method to write text or binary data to the file. We also use the append mode (a or ab) to add text or binary data to the end of the file.
